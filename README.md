# library

This simple app was completed to fulfill one of the assignments in The Odin Project's JavaScript course.

I started out trying to add this app as a page on my "Admin Dashboard" project, but I was not ready to invest the time it would take to figure out how to create a new "card" for each book added to the library.

Finally, I created a simple app with a form to input books and a table to display them. Traversy Media's walk through of this project on YouTube was a great help. It is the first time I used a JavaScript "class" and was overall very informative.
